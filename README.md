MIT EECS 6.01 is titled "Introduction to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science I". 
- **Course Overview**: It is an integrated introduction to electrical engineering and computer science, taught mainly through substantial laboratory experiments with mobile robots. It addresses key issues in the design of engineered artifacts, such as measuring system behaviors, assessing sensor errors, and designing solutions based on models. These issues are explored in the context of computer programs, control systems, and circuits.
- **Key Learning Objectives**: Students will learn to use the fundamental design principles of modularity and abstraction in various EECS contexts. They will understand the role of mathematical models in system design and analysis, and gain exposure to basic knowledge of modern software engineering, linear systems analysis, and electronic circuits.
- **Course Content**: It covers topics related to programming, especially object - oriented programming in Python, including primitives, expressions, functions, and inheritance. It also introduces four modules: software engineering, signals and systems, circuits, and probability and planning.
